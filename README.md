Description:
Create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. The program should provide hints if the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

Requirements:
1. The program should generate a random number between a specified range (e.g., 1 to 80).
2. The user should be prompted to enter their guess.
3. The program should compare the guess with the generated number and provide feedback (e.g., "Too high!" or "Too low!").
4. If the user guesses the correct number, the program should display a success message along with the number of attempts made.
5. The program should continue until the user guesses the correct number.
